        "desc_short": "A New Way to Buy and Sell Fine Wine & Spirits",
        "date_version": "Date: January 2026 | Version: 1.0 (Draft)",
        "back_home": "Back to Home",
        "overview_title": "1. Overview",
        "overview_p1": "Fine wine and spirits (like whiskey) are great investments. Over the last 30 years, they have often made more money for investors than the stock market. But right now, buying and selling them is very hard. It costs too much money, takes too much time, and sometimes it is hard to know if the bottles are real.",
        "overview_p2": "ATF is a new system that connects real wine stored in secure warehouses to the digital world. We use special software called Ink Finance to manage everything safely. We turn physical bottles into digital tokens (like digital shares) that are easy to trade.",
        "overview_p3": "Most other companies are just websites that connect buyers and sellers. ATF is different because we actually own the wine. We are launching with $10 Million of our own high-quality wine from our partner vineyards, Chateau L'Hermitage Lescours and Chateau Mongiron.",
        "problem_title": "2. The Problem: \"Stuck Money\"",
        "problem_subtitle": "Buying wine is easy, but selling it is hard.",
        "problem_cost_title": "It Costs Too Much",
        "problem_cost_desc": "If you want to sell a wine collection today, middlemen (like auction houses) take up to 30% of your money in fees.",
        "problem_slow_title": "It Is Too Slow",
        "problem_slow_desc": "It can take 3 to 6 months to sell your wine and get paid.",
        "problem_real_title": "Is It Real?",
        "problem_real_desc": "The wine industry loses billions of dollars every year to fakes because they still use paper receipts to prove ownership.",
        "solution_title": "3. The Solution: The ATF System",
        "solution_subtitle": "ATF fixes these problems using computer code called \"Smart Contracts.\"",
        "solution_fast_title": "Fast Selling (Liquidity):",
        "solution_fast_desc": "You can sell your wine tokens in seconds, just like selling a stock. You don't have to wait for the bottles to be shipped.",
        "solution_proof_title": "Proof It Is Real (Provenance):",
        "solution_proof_desc": "We create the digital token the moment the wine leaves the barrel. This creates a perfect digital history that cannot be faked.",
        "solution_share_title": "Sharing Ownership:",
        "solution_share_desc": "A rare cask of whiskey can cost $100,000. Most people can't afford that. We split that cask into smaller digital shares, so more people can invest.",
        "tech_title": "4. How It Works (The Technology)",
        "tech_subtitle": "We use a mix of technologies to make sure everything is legal and safe. We use a platform called Ink Finance to run the business.",

        "tech_id_rule_title": "The Rule:",
        "tech_id_rule_desc": "You can only buy or hold this token if you have verified who you are (like showing your passport).",
        "tech_id_why_title": "Why we use it:",
        "tech_id_why_desc": "This keeps us legal. If someone from a banned country tries to buy the token, the system automatically says \"No.\"",
        "tech_id_safe_title": "Safety:",
        "tech_id_safe_desc": "If you lose your password (private key), we can help you get your tokens back. This is not possible with normal crypto like Bitcoin.",
        "tech_wait_title": "4.2 The \"Waiting Room\" (ERC-7540)",
        "tech_wait_subtitle": "Real things move slower than digital things.",

        "tech_wait_problem_desc": "If you ask to take your wine out of the warehouse, it takes a few days to ship.",
        "tech_wait_fix_title": "The Fix:",
        "tech_wait_fix_desc": "We use this standard to create a \"Waiting\" status. It locks your request until the warehouse confirms the wine has actually moved. This keeps the digital record matching the real world perfectly.",
        "tech_ink_title": "4.3 The \"Digital Manager\" (Ink Finance)",
        "tech_ink_desc": "We use Ink Finance software to manage the company's money and decisions.",
